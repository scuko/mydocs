# Add-Ons

Cloud Scripting allows you to install a custom add-on either to a new environment, or to the existing one. You can develop your custom add-on in confines of another - *parent* manifest. Therefore, you need to state the add-on's installation type to *update* and declare essential properties within the *addons* section.  
   
You can install the developed add-on either by specifying a target <a href="/1.6/creating-manifest/selecting-containers/#all-containers-by-group" target="blank">*nodeGroup*</a>, or by calling the <a href="/1.6/creating-manifest/actions/#installaddon" target="blank">*installAddon*</a> action.             

The following example illustrates the add-on's installation to a specific *nodeGroup* (layer).

    name: Custom Addon
    onInstall:
      api [cp]: environment.control.RestartNodesByGroup

In the example above, the <a href="https://docs.jelastic.com/api/" target="_blank">Jelastic API</a> <b>*RestartNodesByGroup*</b> method is executed after the environment creation is completed. The compute node is restarted at the end of the manifest installation procedure. Herewith, the add-on is installed, if the *parent* manifest's installation type is *install*. When the add-on is installed, the **Add-ons** tab for the corresponding compute node becomes available at the dashboard.

The following example illustrates the add-on's installation by calling the *installAddon* action. You can call this action for both *update* and *install* installation types of a *parent* manifest.

Through this example, a new *test.log* file is created during the *onInstall* action execution. You can declare the add-on's expected behaviour within the *addons* section, while the *installAddon* action is needed to specify the appropriate add-on's identifier.
